# GoMusic WebApp
This is a web application for online music streaming, developed as a project for my second-year university course. The website is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: The frontend of the website is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Backend**: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing a scalable and efficient server-side architecture.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used as the database management system to store user information, music metadata, and user-generated content.
- **Authentication**: User authentication and session management are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access control.
- **External APIs**: Integration with external APIs allows for features like fetching music metadata, social sharing, and personalized recommendations.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

2. Install the required dependencies for both the backend:

3. Configure the environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and provide the necessary environment variables, such as the MongoDB connection string, API keys, etc.

4. Start the development server:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
